        <h1>We're Currently Upgrading Our Platform</h1>
        <p>Dear valued customers,</p>
        <p>We are in the process of transitioning our platform and website to a new cloud provider. During this time, if you have a website hosted with us, rest assured that it will remain online. We will migrate your site as soon as possible once we are able to start the process with the new provider. In the meantime you can check our GitHub repository</p>
        <p>We're excited to introduce our new product, <strong>Create</strong>. With Create, you’ll be able to build and manage your own websites without needing our assistance. Simply create an account, choose a plan with a free domain included, and start building your site. Once you’re ready, publish it and see it live in less than 180 seconds!</p>
        <p>If you are experiencing downtime, need to make an important change or any other kind of urgent issue with your website, please don’t hesitate to <span class="contact-info">email us at <a href="mailto:help-p1@revitalweb.com">help-p1@revitalweb.com</a></span>.</p>
