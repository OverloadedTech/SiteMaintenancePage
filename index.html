<h1>Dear Cutomers, we are currently in the process of transitioning our platform and website to a new cloud provider.
If you have a website hosted with us, don't worry, at the moment it will still remain online and we will migrate it as soon as possible after the new provider allows us to begin
We will also launch our new product with the website: Create, with Create you will be able to create your websites fully by yourself without needing our help, just create an account, buy a plan with free domain included and start building your website, then once you are ready, hit publish and your website will be published in less than 180 seconds

If you are a new customer planning to use RevivalWeb we are sorry for this inconvenience and we suggest to visit this paga again in a few days
Thanks for understanding</h1>
